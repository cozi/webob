0.8.5
-----

* Added response methods ``resp.encode_content()`` and
  ``resp.decode_content()`` to gzip or ungzip content.

* ``Response(status=404)`` now works (before you would have to use
  ``status="404 Not Found"``).

* Bugfix (typo) with reusing POST body.

* Added ``226 IM Used`` response status.

* Backport of ``string.Template`` included for Python 2.3
  compatibility.

0.8.4
-----

* ``__setattr__`` would keep ``Request`` subclasses from having
  properly settable environ proxies (like ``req.path_info``).

0.8.3
-----

* ``request.POST`` was giving FieldStorage objects for *every*
  attribute, not just file uploads.  This is fixed now.


* Added request attributes ``req.server_name`` and ``req.server_port``
  for the environ keys ``SERVER_NAME`` and ``SERVER_PORT``.

* Avoid exceptions in ``req.content_length``, even if
  ``environ['CONTENT_LENGTH']`` is somehow invalid.

0.8.2
-----

* Python 2.3 compatibility: backport of ``reversed(seq)``

* Made separate ``.exception`` attribute on ``webob.exc`` objects,
  since new-style classes can't be raised as exceptions.

* Deprecate ``req.postvars`` and ``req.queryvars``, instead using the
  sole names ``req.GET`` and ``req.POST`` (also ``req.str_GET`` and
  ``req.str_POST``).  The old names give a warning; will give an error
  in next release, and be completely gone in the following release.

* ``req.user_agent`` is now just a simple string (parsing the
  User-Agent header was just too volatile, and required too much
  knowledge about current browsers).  Similarly,
  ``req.referer_search_query()`` is gone.

* Added parameters ``version`` and ``comment`` to
  ``Response.set_cookie()``, per William Dode's suggestion.

* Was accidentally consuming file uploads, instead of putting the
  ``FieldStorage`` object directly in the parameters.

0.8.1
-----

* Added ``res.set_cookie(..., httponly=True)`` to set the ``HttpOnly``
  attribute on the cookie, which keeps Javascript from reading the
  cookie.

* Added some WebDAV-related responses to ``webob.exc``

* Set default ``Last-Modified`` when using ``response.cache_expire()``
  (fixes issue with Opera)

* Generally fix ``.cache_control``

First release.  Nothing is new, or everything is new, depending on how
you think about it.
