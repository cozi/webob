svn trunk
---------

* Changed how ``charset`` is determined on :class:`webob.Request`
  objects.  Now the ``charset`` parameter is read on the Content-Type
  header, if it is present.  Otherwise a ``default_charset`` parameter
  is read, or the ``charset`` argument to the Request constructor.
  This is more similar to how :class:`webob.Response` handles the
  charset.

0.9.6.1
-------

* Fixed :method:`Response.__init__`, which for some content types would
  raise an exception.

* The ``req.body`` property will not recreate a StringIO object
  unnecessarily when rereading the body.

0.9.6
-----

* Removed `environ_getter` from :class:`webob.Request`.  This
  largely-unused option allowed a Request object to be instantiated
  with a dynamic underlying environ.  Since it wasn't used much, and
  might have been ill-advised from the beginning, and affected
  performance, it has been removed (from Chris McDonough).

* Speed ups for :method:`webob.Response.__init__` and
  :method:`webob.Request.__init__`

* Fix defaulting of ``CONTENT_TYPE`` instead of ``CONTENT_LENGTH`` to
  0 in ``Request.str_POST``.

* Added :method:`webob.Response.copy`

0.9.5
-----

* Fix a potential memory leak with HEAD requests and 304 responses.

* Make :func:`webob.html_escape` respect the ``.__html__()`` magic
  method, which allows you to use HTML in
  :class`webob.exc.HTTPException` instances.

* Handle unicode values for ``resp.location``.

* Allow arbitrary keyword arguments to ``exc.HTTP*`` (the same
  keywords you can send to :class:`webob.Response`).

* Allow setting :method:`webob.Response.cache_expires` (usually it is
  called as a method).  This is primarily to allow
  ``Response(cache_expires=True)``.

0.9.4
-----

* Quiet Python 2.6 deprecation warnings.

* Added an attribute ``unicode_errors`` to :class:`webob.Response` --
  if set to something like ``unicode_errors='replace'`` it will decode
  ``resp.body`` appropriately.  The default is ``strict`` (which was
  the former un-overridable behavior).

0.9.3
-----

* Fixed ``resp.set_cookie(max_age=timedelta(...))``

* ``request.POST`` now supports PUT requests with the appropriate
  Content-Type.

0.9.2
-----

* Change formatting of cookie expires, to use the more traditional
  format ``Wed, 5-May-2001 15:34:10 GMT`` (dashes instead of spaces).
  Browsers should deal with either format, but some other code expects
  dashes.

* Added in ``sorted`` function for backward compatibility with Python
  2.3.

* Allow keyword arguments to :class:`webob.Request`, which assign
  attributes (possibly overwriting values in the environment).

* Added methods :meth:`webob.Request.make_body_seekable` and
  :meth:`webob.Request.copy_body`, which make it easier to share a
  request body among different consuming applications, doing something
  like `req.make_body_seekable(); req.body_file.seek(0)`

0.9.1
-----

* ``request.params.copy()`` now returns a writable MultiDict (before
  it returned an unwritable object).

* There were several things broken with ``UnicodeMultiDict`` when
  ``decode_param_names`` is turned on (when the dictionary keys are
  unicode).

* You can pass keyword arguments to ``Request.blank()`` that will be
  used to construct ``Request`` (e.g., ``Request.blank('/',
  decode_param_names=True)``).

* If you set headers like ``response.etag`` to a unicode value, they
  will be encoded as ISO-8859-1 (however, they will remain encoded,
  and ``response.etag`` will not be a unicode value).

* When parsing, interpret times with no timezone as UTC (previously
  they would be interpreted as local time).

* Set the Expires property on cookies when using
  ``response.set_cookie()``.  This is inherited from ``max_age``.

0.9
---

* Added ``req.urlarg``, which represents positional arguments in
  ``environ['wsgiorg.routing_args']``.

* For Python 2.4, added attribute get/set proxies on exception objects
  from, for example, ``webob.exc.HTTPNotFound().exception``, so that
  they act more like normal response objects (despite not being
  new-style classes or ``webob.Response`` objects).  In Python 2.5 the
  exceptions are ``webob.Response`` objects.

Backward Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``Response`` constructor has changed: it is now ``Response([body],
  [status], ...)`` (before it was ``Response([status], [body], ...)``).
  Body may be str or unicode.

* The ``Response`` class defaults to ``text/html`` for the
  Content-Type, and ``utf8`` for the charset (charset is only set on
  ``text/*`` and ``application/*+xml`` responses).

Bugfixes and Small Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use ``BaseCookie`` instead of ``SimpleCookie`` for parsing cookies.

* Added ``resp.write(text)`` method, which is equivalent to
  ``resp.body += text`` or ``resp.unicode_body += text``, depending on
  the type of ``text``.

* The ``decode_param_names`` argument (used like
  ``Request(decode_param_names=True)``) was being ignored.

* Unicode decoding of file uploads and file upload filenames were
  causing errors when decoding non-file-upload fields (both fixes from
  Ryan Barrett).

0.8.5
-----

* Added response methods ``resp.encode_content()`` and
  ``resp.decode_content()`` to gzip or ungzip content.

* ``Response(status=404)`` now works (before you would have to use
  ``status="404 Not Found"``).

* Bugfix (typo) with reusing POST body.

* Added ``226 IM Used`` response status.

* Backport of ``string.Template`` included for Python 2.3
  compatibility.

0.8.4
-----

* ``__setattr__`` would keep ``Request`` subclasses from having
  properly settable environ proxies (like ``req.path_info``).

0.8.3
-----

* ``request.POST`` was giving FieldStorage objects for *every*
  attribute, not just file uploads.  This is fixed now.


* Added request attributes ``req.server_name`` and ``req.server_port``
  for the environ keys ``SERVER_NAME`` and ``SERVER_PORT``.

* Avoid exceptions in ``req.content_length``, even if
  ``environ['CONTENT_LENGTH']`` is somehow invalid.

0.8.2
-----

* Python 2.3 compatibility: backport of ``reversed(seq)``

* Made separate ``.exception`` attribute on ``webob.exc`` objects,
  since new-style classes can't be raised as exceptions.

* Deprecate ``req.postvars`` and ``req.queryvars``, instead using the
  sole names ``req.GET`` and ``req.POST`` (also ``req.str_GET`` and
  ``req.str_POST``).  The old names give a warning; will give an error
  in next release, and be completely gone in the following release.

* ``req.user_agent`` is now just a simple string (parsing the
  User-Agent header was just too volatile, and required too much
  knowledge about current browsers).  Similarly,
  ``req.referer_search_query()`` is gone.

* Added parameters ``version`` and ``comment`` to
  ``Response.set_cookie()``, per William Dode's suggestion.

* Was accidentally consuming file uploads, instead of putting the
  ``FieldStorage`` object directly in the parameters.

0.8.1
-----

* Added ``res.set_cookie(..., httponly=True)`` to set the ``HttpOnly``
  attribute on the cookie, which keeps Javascript from reading the
  cookie.

* Added some WebDAV-related responses to ``webob.exc``

* Set default ``Last-Modified`` when using ``response.cache_expire()``
  (fixes issue with Opera)

* Generally fix ``.cache_control``

0.8
---

First release.  Nothing is new, or everything is new, depending on how
you think about it.
