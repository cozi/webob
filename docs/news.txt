svn trunk
---------

* Python 2.3 compatibility: backport of ``reversed(seq)``

* Made separate ``.exception`` attribute on ``webob.exc`` objects,
  since new-style classes can't be raised as exceptions.

* Deprecate ``req.postvars`` and ``req.queryvars``, instead using the
  sole names ``req.GET`` and ``req.POST`` (also ``req.str_GET`` and
  ``req.str_POST``).  The old names give a warning; will give an error
  in next release, and be completely gone in the following release.

* ``req.user_agent`` is now just a simple string (parsing the
  User-Agent header was just too transient, and required too much
  knowledge about current browsers).  Similarly,
  ``req.referer_search_query()`` is gone.

* Added parameters ``version`` and ``comment`` to
  ``Response.set_cookie()``, per William Dode's suggestion.

* Was accidentally consuming file uploads, instead of putting the
  ``FieldStorage`` object directly in the parameters.

0.8.1
-----

* Added ``res.set_cookie(..., httponly=True)`` to set the ``HttpOnly``
  attribute on the cookie, which keeps Javascript from reading the
  cookie.

* Added some WebDAV-related responses to ``webob.exc``

* Set default ``Last-Modified`` when using ``response.cache_expire()``
  (fixes issue with Opera)

* Generally fix ``.cache_control``

0.8

First release.  Nothing is new, or everything is new, depending on how
you think about it.
